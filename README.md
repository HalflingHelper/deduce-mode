### From File
> [!NOTE]
> Releases are less frequently updated than the extension on the marketplace, so you might not always get the latest features.
- To get the extension, download the latest `.vsix` file from [releases](https://github.com/HalflingHelper/deduce-mode/releases) 
and put it somewhere you'll remember. You can then add it as an extension in vscode.

## Requirements
Preferably you will have installed Deduce and Python 3.10+, otherwise the extension is not of much use to you. ðŸ˜ƒ

If the `ms-python.python` extension is installed, and you have not set a Python path to use for deduce, then the extension
will attempt to use a Python environment provided by that extension.


## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:
- `deduce-mode.pythonInstallPath`: The location of the Python executable you want to run Deduce with. Default `python`.
- `deduce-mode.deduceInstallPath`: The location of your `deduce.py` file.
- `deduce-mode.libraryPaths`: An array of folders to use with deduce's `--dir` option. Defaults to deduce's `lib` folder.

## Known Issues
- Nothing right now!
